# XtendableExports

I finished in the ExportFileService late last night while working on returning the file.  

 Obviously there are things I only did due to time constraints. 

I would not have done a string concatenation for the fields and the subsequent parser thing.  

I also would have found a better solution for delimeters.

I was hoping to have time to create some sort of front end export wizard for the creation and saving of exports as well but ran out of time.

Thanks!
Todd
